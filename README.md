# ðŸŽ¯ Face Recognition System using Python, OpenCV & Deep Learning

This is a simple AI/ML-based **Face Recognition System** built with Python 3.9.5, OpenCV, and the `face_recognition` library (built on top of dlibâ€™s deep learning model). It identifies and labels faces in test images based on trained face encodings.

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.9.5  
- **Libraries**:
  - `face_recognition`
  - `dlib==19.22.1`
  - `OpenCV` (`cv2`)
  - `NumPy==1.26.4`
  - `os` (standard library)

## ðŸš€ Features

- Detects and encodes faces from training images.
- Compares faces from test images with known encodings.
- Labels and displays recognized faces using bounding boxes.
- Logs unmatched or missing faces with appropriate messages.
